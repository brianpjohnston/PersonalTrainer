# PersonalTrainer
Personal Trainer app for school project


Here’s the scenario.
You’re a personal trainer who trains your clients at their home. Your clients pay for a given number of training sessions each month. Each time you train them, you mark off a session. Currently, you carry a binder around with each customers sign in sheet to each session. This has started to become tedious, not to mention that you forget your pen every time. Since you’re in school and taking the Introduction to Android course, you decide to build an application to handle this for you.
For this assignment, create an android project for our Personal Trainer Customer Management Application. Name it whatever you like. After you’ve created your project, search the web and find some icons. There are plenty out there. I want you to add an image resource for the logo.
Add string resources for the following:
The Application Name
Successful Login Message
Unsuccessful Login Message
User Name (Make it jdoe)
Password (Make it welcome1)
Add any other resources you may want to use in your app.
Our application will require the following permissions to run:
Ability to write to settings
Ability to access the built in camera.
Ability to write to external storage
Modify your application manifest for these permissions. (See page 120)
Create a login activity. You can use the login activity code template that’s an option from the new activity menu or create your own. Make this activity the launch activity. Don’t worry about coding anything else for now. We’ll keep the view simple for now until we discuss user interfaces next week. When I run your app, the login activity should start.
Part II.
Let’s talk about the functionality.
The functionality the application will support:
Allow the user to enter a new customer
Display a list of customers and their picture
Allow the user to take a picture of a customer
Allow the user to view customer sessions
Allow the user to mark a customer session as completed
Allow the user to enter new customer sessions
Allow a customer to sign the screen for a completed session
Allow the user to submit customer billing information. I.E Credit Card Information.
Allow the user to submit payment for customer when signing up for new sessions.
Generate a receipt for the customer after payment success and allow the receipt to be sent to a printer if available or allow the user to send it via email.
